# Real-time Sign Language Translator
The software is designed to enable text input through hand sign language recognition, eliminating the need for physical interaction with a keyboard. Utilizing the device’s front-facing camera, the program detects hand signs made by the user and translates them into corresponding alphabetic characters (a–z). These characters are sequentially added to form a word-in-progress.

As the user constructs a word, the software dynamically offers word suggestions through an auto-completion feature, which updates in real time as new characters are detected. Users may either select a suggested word from the list or continue inputting additional characters. Once a word is selected, it is appended to the final output area, allowing the user to build complete sentences. The finalized text can then be copied for use elsewhere.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Python, PyQt, cv2, MediaPipe, Pytorch

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write *something*. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *wow I actually did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
